No username was specified initially during the attempted login. The attempt was made using a non-interactive SSH connection (NODEVssh).\n\nAdvice:\n\n1. Investigate the remote host: Determine the purpose of the host 218.188.2.4. Look for any known malicious activity associated with that IP address.\n2. Disable root login over SSH: Prevent direct root logins via SSH by setting `PermitRootLogin no` in your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file. Always use a standard user account and then escalate privileges using `sudo`.\n3. Strengthen SSH security: Consider implementing stronger authentication methods, such as key-based authentication, and disabling password authentication entirely.\n4. Monitor SSH logs regularly: Watch for repeated failed login attempts from suspicious IP addresses. Implement intrusion detection or prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to automatically block such IPs.\n5. Review firewall rules: Ensure your firewall is configured to limit SSH access to trusted networks or IP addresses.\n6. Check for brute-force attacks: Analyze logs for multiple failed attempts from the same IP within a short time frame, which could indicate a brute-force attack. Employ tools like `fail2ban` to automatically block IPs that exhibit such behavior."

There are also attempts targeting the 'guest' user and 'test' user. 'check pass; user unknown' indicates attempts with invalid usernames. Several IPs show repetitive failed login attempts, suggesting automated attacks. Authentication failures are largely related to SSH, but there are also some Kerberos authentication failures noted.\n\nSessions Opened/Closed:\n\nThe logs show sessions opened and closed for users 'cyrus', 'news', and 'test'. The 'test' user seems to have frequent sessions opening and closing. The 'cyrus' and 'news' user's sessions are consistently followed by an \"ALERT exited abnormally with [1]\" message, indicating a problem with these sessions.\n\nConnections:\n\nMany connections are logged, showing source IPs and hostnames. Some connections are followed by multiple authentication failures from the same IP, indicating brute-force login attempts.  Repeated connections from the same IP addresses are visible, often in short bursts.  Some connections do not resolve to a hostname.\n\nOther events:\n\nThere are instances of cupsd (CUPS Daemon) being shut down and restarted, indicating print service restarts. There is a 'User unknown timed out' message.  There are SNMP packet logs. There is an anonymous FTP login. There is a Kernel restart with some system information.\n\nAdvice:\n\n1.  Implement Fail2Ban: Use Fail2Ban or similar intrusion prevention software to automatically block IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behavior, such as multiple failed login attempts.\n2.  Disable Root Login: Disable direct SSH login for the root user.  Force users to log in with another account and then use 'su' or 'sudo' to gain root privileges.\n3.  Use Strong Passwords: Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts.\n4.  Consider Key-Based Authentication: Implement SSH key-based authentication instead of password authentication for enhanced security.\n5.  Review User Accounts: Regularly review user accounts and disable or remove any unused or unnecessary accounts.\n6.  Monitor Logs: Set up a system for continuous log monitoring and analysis to quickly detect and respond to security incidents.\n7.  Investigate \"ALERT exited abnormally\": Investigate the cause of \"ALERT exited abnormally with [1]\" for users 'cyrus' and 'news'. It suggests those services might be crashing or malfunctioning.\n8.  Kerberos authentication failed: Check the Kerberos configuration.\n\nSecurity Hardening:\n\n*   Firewall Configuration: Ensure your firewall is properly configured to allow only necessary traffic.\n*   Update Software: Keep your system software up to date with the latest security patches.\n*   Intrusion Detection System: Consider implementing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect malicious activity in real time.\n\nFocus on the SSH Authentication Failures as they are the most prominent indicators of potential security breaches."

There are numerous SSH authentication failures, primarily targeting the root user and often originating from various IP addresses and hostnames which indicate brute-force attacks. There also appear to be problems with Kerberos authentication from a specific IP address. There are issues related to the automatic configuration of the mouse and there are repeated shutdowns and startups of printing service (cupsd). Finally there is ALERT issue for user cyrus, maybe an issue on service itself.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1.

Service Monitoring:\n    *   Investigate the \"ALERT exited abnormally with [1]\" errors for users 'cyrus' and 'news'. Check the logs specific to these services to diagnose the cause.\n    *   Monitor the health and stability of cupsd. If it's restarting frequently, investigate the cause, such as printer driver issues or configuration problems.\n\n3.  Kerberos:\n    *   Examine the Kerberos configuration and logs for errors related to replay cache issues. Ensure that the Kerberos server is properly synchronized and that the client configurations are correct.\n\n4.  FTP Security:\n    *   Ensure that the FTP server is configured securely. If anonymous FTP is enabled, review the permissions and access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n5.  System Updates:\n    *   The kernel is outdated. Update kernel to the latest stable release to patch any security vulnerabilities.\n\n6.  Firewall:\n    *   Review current firewall rules and make sure only essential ports are open."
