Use Strong Passwords: Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts.\n4.  Consider Key-Based Authentication: Implement SSH key-based authentication instead of password authentication for enhanced security.\n5.

Kerberos:\n    *   Examine the Kerberos configuration and logs for errors related to replay cache issues. Ensure that the Kerberos server is properly synchronized and that the client configurations are correct.\n\n4.  FTP Security:\n    *   Ensure that the FTP server is configured securely. If anonymous FTP is enabled, review the permissions and access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n5.  System Updates:\n    *   The kernel is outdated. Update kernel to the latest stable release to patch any security vulnerabilities.\n\n6.  Firewall:\n    *   Review current firewall rules and make sure only essential ports are open."

This is a common brute-force attack attempt. Because it is a failed attempt, your system prevented unauthorized access.\n\nAdvice:\n\n1.  Disable Root Login via SSH:  Disallow direct root logins via SSH.  Force users to log in with a regular account and then use `su` or `sudo` to gain root privileges. Edit your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file, setting `PermitRootLogin no` and restart the SSH service.\n\n2.  Use Strong Passwords: Ensure all user accounts (especially those with sudo privileges) have strong, unique passwords.\n\n3.  Implement Key-Based Authentication: Use SSH keys instead of passwords for authentication.  This is much more secure.\n\n4.  Enable and Configure a Firewall: Use a firewall like `iptables` or `ufw` to restrict SSH access to only trusted IP addresses or networks.\n\n5.  Install and Configure Fail2ban: Fail2ban automatically bans IP addresses that show malicious signs, such as too many password failures.  Configure it to protect your SSH service.\n\n6.  Regularly Review Logs:  Monitor your authentication logs for suspicious activity.  Automate log analysis where possible.\n\n7.  Consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA for an extra layer of security.\n\n8.  Keep System Updated: Ensure your operating system and all software are up-to-date with the latest security patches."

Check for Vulnerable Services: Investigate why the 'cyrus' and 'news' service sessions are failing.\n6.  Secure FTP: Disable anonymous ftp logins\n7.  Investigate Kerberos failures: Ensure proper Kerberos configuration. Check ticket validity, clock synchronization, and network connectivity.\n8.
